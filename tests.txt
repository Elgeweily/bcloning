reverse laps are very important otherwise the car falls off the dirt part

lenet is good for track 1 only (though with some vibrations) NVIDIA model is good for both tracks

vibration is caused by fast speed (30)

track2 started working after using grayscale...after augmenting with brightness it became almost perfect

0.2 brightness almost perfect except the difficult bit
0.15 not much different but the loss is higher, and the difficult bit seems a little bit better
0.3  worse loss 0.07
0.1
